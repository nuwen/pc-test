## Press Centric Test Project

  1.  User  should  be  able  to  select an Account by its name from a
  dropdown with auto-complete functionality

  2. Upon selection a detailed data for the selected Account should be
  displayed

  3.  On  the  details page there should be a delete button that would
  delete the selected Account

  4. In addition to the above add a component that shows 3 last viewed
  accounts, linked to their details. (We expect you to use Redux store
  for that component)

For  the  purposes  of  that  test we provide a REST API on one of our
development servers with the following 3 calls:

  - GET a list of Accounts
  - GET Account's details
  - DELETE an Account

Note: DELETE call won't actually remove the Account from the back end,
but still must be executed.

For the detailed API reference and server URL & details please see the
attached API documentation.

The  simple web application must be runnable from the command line and
would    display    a    page   in   the   browser,   accessible   via
http://localhost/index.html

Feel  free  to use any CSS framework that you like in your submission.
No  need  for  security or anything fancy for this project, but if you
want to show off and impress in any way - feel free to do so.

Preferred method of delivery is a github repository, but an email with
a package would do just fine either.

There is no time limit on this challenge, we want a submission that is
of a production-level quality, and that you're proud of. Keep in mind,
however,  that the time that took you to finish the assignment will be
one of the factors in our decision to make you an offer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
