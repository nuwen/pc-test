## Getting Started

 1. cd into project directory
 2. execute `yarn` in terminal to begin installing packages
 3. run `yarn start` to begin hosting project
 4. visit https://localhost:3000/

## Press Centric Test Project

  1.  User  should  be  able  to  select an Account by its name from a
  dropdown with auto-complete functionality

  2. Upon selection a detailed data for the selected Account should be
  displayed

  3.  On  the  details page there should be a delete button that would
  delete the selected Account

  4. In addition to the above add a component that shows 3 last viewed
  accounts, linked to their details. (We expect you to use Redux store
  for that component)

For  the  purposes  of  that  test we provide a REST API on one of our
development servers with the following 3 calls:

  - GET a list of Accounts
  - GET Account's details
  - DELETE an Account

Note: DELETE call won't actually remove the Account from the back end,
but still must be executed.

For the detailed API reference and server URL & details please see the
attached API documentation.

The  simple web application must be runnable from the command line and
would    display    a    page   in   the   browser,   accessible   via
http://localhost/index.html

Feel  free  to use any CSS framework that you like in your submission.
No  need  for  security or anything fancy for this project, but if you
want to show off and impress in any way - feel free to do so.

Preferred method of delivery is a github repository, but an email with
a package would do just fine either.

There is no time limit on this challenge, we want a submission that is
of a production-level quality, and that you're proud of. Keep in mind,
however,  that the time that took you to finish the assignment will be
one of the factors in our decision to make you an offer.
